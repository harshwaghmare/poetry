The Soliloquy of Marc Antony
----------------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou ART the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liveth in these ruinious times
woe to the hands
another line

yET ANOTHER LINE


added this also


Blood and destruction in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
there's gonna be blood everywhere
that mothers shall but smile when they behold
